Camera 4 Dummies
================

A simple front end to [http://dati.camera.it/it/](http://dati.camera.it/it/).  Developed during
`#Code4Italy Hackathon @Montecitorio` in May 2014.

The primary goal of this project is to create an infrastructure where people armed with knowledge
 of just [Sparql](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) and HTML can create webpages displaying
 wealth of information made available from an Open Data provider.  In this prototype, we created
 an initial prototype of this concept by offering a simple to use website with OpenData from
 Montecitorio allowing anyone to navigate the data with simple clicks.
 
Sample Website:  
* [http://marcoslin.github.io/Code4Italy/](http://marcoslin.github.io/Code4Italy/)

Data is sourced directly from [endpoints](http://dati.camera.it/it/dati/) so the updated data is
immediately accessible when released by Montecitorio.  **No lags or overnight refresh!!!**
