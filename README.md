Camera 4 Dummies
================

A simple front end to [http://dati.camera.it/it/](http://dati.camera.it/it/).  Developed during
`#Code4Italy Hackathon @Montecitorio` in May 2014.

This project's purpose is to make wealth of OpenData provided by Montecitorio available to normal
users.  The current prototype illustrate how a non-technical person can navigate the data with simple
clicks.

Data is sourced directly from [endpoints](http://dati.camera.it/it/dati/) so the updated data is
immediately accessible when released by Montecitorio.  **No lags or overnight refresh!!!**
